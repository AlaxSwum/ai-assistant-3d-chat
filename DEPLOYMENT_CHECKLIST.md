## üõ† Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Code Preparation
- [x] All changes committed and tested locally
- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify all files are included in repository

### Step 2: Render Deployment (Choose One)

#### Option A: Blueprint Deployment (Recommended)
- [ ] Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Click "New" ‚Üí "Blueprint"
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Wait for automatic deployment using `render.yaml`

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
- [ ] Deploy backend web service first
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Deploy frontend static site
- [ ] Update frontend with backend URL

### Step 3: Environment Variables Setup
```
Backend Environment Variables:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = 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
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = 1

Frontend Environment Variables:
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] **Backend Health**: Test `/api/test` endpoint
- [ ] **Frontend Access**: Visit frontend URL
- [ ] **Chat Function**: Send test message
- [ ] **Voice Function**: Test microphone input
- [ ] **Audio Output**: Verify TTS playback

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Ask a question via text chat
- [ ] Test voice recording and recognition
- [ ] Verify AI responses are generated
- [ ] Check audio playback quality
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test on different browsers

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Response times < 5 seconds for chat
- [ ] Audio generation < 10 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks in prolonged use
- [ ] Error handling working properly

### Security Verification
- [ ] API keys not exposed in frontend
- [ ] CORS headers properly set
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (Render default)

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Render Dashboard
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Set up alerts if needed

### Application Monitoring
- [ ] Backend logs accessible
- [ ] Error tracking working
- [ ] Audio file storage monitored

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Backend API responds to health checks
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Chat conversations work end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Voice recognition processes audio
- ‚úÖ AI generates appropriate responses
- ‚úÖ Audio playback functions correctly
- ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness confirmed

## üö® Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally to isolate issues
4. Redeploy from known good commit
5. Contact support if needed

## üìà Next Steps After Deployment

### Immediate
- [ ] Document live URLs
- [ ] Share with stakeholders
- [ ] Monitor initial usage

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Upgrade to better AI models (with credits)
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Implement conversation history
- [ ] Add more languages
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Monitor Usage
- [ ] OpenRouter API usage
- [ ] Render resource consumption
- [ ] Storage usage for audio files

### Optimization Tips
- Limit audio file retention
- Monitor API rate limits
- Use free models when possible
- Scale resources based on usage
